# MudBlazing Pizzas

Web Assembly with ASP.NET core hosted application to order pizzas. 

This is a practice project I am currently working on, following the 
[Blazor - app building workshop tutorial](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/blazor-workshop) 
by .NET Foundation, Blazing Pizza. 

The user interface is implemented using MudBlazor component library.
